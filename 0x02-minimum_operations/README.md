 Minimum Operations

 Description

This project involves writing a Python function to determine the minimum number of operations required to obtain exactly `n` characters of 'H' in a text file starting with one 'H'. The only allowed operations are "Copy All" and "Paste".

 Requirements

- The project is implemented in Python 3.4.3.
- All scripts are designed to be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- The code should conform to PEP 8 style guidelines.
- The script must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

 Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to get exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The desired number of 'H' characters.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of operations needed, or 0 if n is impossible to achieve.
    """
