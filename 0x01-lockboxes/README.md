# 0x01. Lockboxes

## Overview
This project focuses on determining whether all lockboxes can be opened, based on keys found in other boxes. It involves concepts like list manipulation, graph traversal, and algorithmic thinking.

## File Description

- **0-lockboxes.py**: Contains the function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that takes a list of lists (boxes with keys) and returns `True` if all boxes can be unlocked, otherwise returns `False`.

## Key Concepts
- Lists and List Manipulation
- Graph Theory (for traversal)
- Recursion
- Queue and Stack
- Set Operations

## Example Usage
```bash
./main_0.py
True
True
False
